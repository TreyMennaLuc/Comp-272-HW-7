# Fastest Algorithm - 6B
- 6B is the fastest algorithm is the best because it has the best worst time complexity of O(N) where the other two are O(N log N) 
# Results
 -After letting my program run all day not even my first algorithm finished so I answered the second part based on what I know about the time complexities of each algorithm
